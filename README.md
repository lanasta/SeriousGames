# Black Ops 420: A Surgery to Study For

This is a game that Team Cosmic Fire of COMP585 Spring 2016 created for UNC Neurosurgery residents. Neurosurgery residents need mental breaks when studying to retain information. Often they feel guilty when doing intense study to take the necessary breaks for retention. The game would provide enough humor and mental downtime so that information can be retained and meaningful.
