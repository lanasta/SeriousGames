    Serious Game Design Document Outline<br>
1. Title Page	
1.1. Game Name: Black Ops 420
1.2. Tag line
1.3. Team: Cosmic Fire
1.4. Date of last update
2. Game Overview
2.1. Game Concept: our game concept is a series of mini-games loosely connected through an overarching narrative. The concept is centered on the main purpose of the game, namely, that the client wanted a game that incorporated traditional study with scheduled breaks between the studying.
2.2. Target Audience: the target audience of the game is residents in the Neurosurgery program at UNC-Chapel Hill Hospitals.
2.3. Genre(s): Action; Adventure.
2.4. Purpose of the Game – pedagogical objective(s) for educational games, training goal, or intended social impact: The game’s purpose is educational/training. It switches between flashcard learning and gameplay.
2.5. Look and Feel – What is the basic look and feel of the game?  What is the visual style? The visual style has not been clearly established yet. Conceptually, the game should be cartoonish with the characters and objects designed to be humorous.  
2.6. Intended Use – How will the game be inserted into a pedagogical scenario or how will it be used in training, therapy, rehabilitation, etc : The intended use of the game is to help Neurosurgery residents study material related to their training.
3. Gameplay
3.1. Objectives – What are the objectives of the game?
·         Objectives of Squirrel Pacification
o   See how many squirrels can be saved
o   How long a player can hold out
·         Objectives of Bunny Hoo Hoo, Critical Mass
o   How many carrots can the player land in Bunny Hoo Hoo’s mouth.
3.2. Game Progression and Play Flow – How does the game flow for the game player? The game flow is not going to be able to smooth because of the inherent fact that the game must be split between gameplay and studying. With that said, the game should still flow somewhat smoothly from study session to game and back to studying. Inside the games themselves, progression through the games will be fast. Any scenario designed will either be setup so that a player cannot survive for more than three or four minutes or that the level can be beaten in three to four minutes.
3.3. Mission/challenge Structure
3.4. Puzzle Structure
4. Mechanics (Key Section)
4.1. Rules – include both implicit and explicit rules. 
·         Rules for Squirrel Pacification: the player will not be able to move from defending the coffee cup pile; the squirrels must be pacified or else the player will lose the game.
4.2. Model of the game universe.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact?
4.3. Physics – How does the physical universe work?
·         Physics in the game will work like the physics in the real world.
4.4. Economy – What is the economy of the game? How does it work?
4.5. Character movement in the game
·         In Squirrel pacification the only thing that a player will be capable of moving is the avatar’s arms and torso in order to change where the gun is pointing
4.6. Objects – how to pick them up and move them 
·         Objects in Squirrel Pacification will be the Starbucks coffee and the Acorn shots. The acorn shots will have a set amount (makes the player be accurate with their shots) there will be a tree above the player that will periodically be shook to make more acorns fall down and let the player reload the acorn shooter. The starbucks cups will be the players health- if all the cups get taken then the game is over. The squirrels will be able to interact with the cups and carry them off screen if they are able to reach the cups.
4.7. Actions, including whatever switches and buttons are used, interacting with objects, and what means of communication are used
·         The spacebar will be used to shoot the acorn shooter, the arrow keys will be used to move the shooters position.
4.8. Combat – If there is combat or even conflict, how is this specifically modeled?
·         Combat in Squirrel Pacification will be modeled after a simplistic aim and fire model
4.9. Screen Flow – How each screen is related to every other and a description of the purpose of each screen
4.10. Game Options – What are the options and how do they affect game play?
4.11. Replaying and saving
4.12. Cheats and Easter Eggs
5. Story and Narrative  
5.1. Back story Black Ops 420 is a secret crack squad of specialists gathered specifically to prevent disasters that could threaten the United States and/or the world. The squad is under direct command of the President of the United States, Baroque Ohmama and answer to no other authority in the world.
5.2. Plot elements: Since the game that we are designing is going to be fragmented by nature, the narrative should help build a sense of cohesiveness and singularity for the player throughout. While each game will be different as far as events that unfold, the underlying plot will be that Black Ops 420 have been ordered by the president to divert or stop the disaster that is about to befall the world.
5.3. Game story progression the game will most likely not have a linear style story progression that ends with a definitive ending. Instead, each mini-game inside the game will serve as an anecdote or recounting of a mission that Black Ops 420 undertook to prevent the world from being destroyed.
5.4. Cut scenes -- descriptions include the actors, the setting, and the storyboard or script.
Each mini game would begin with a head and shoulders animation of the President explaining the mission and what the player must do to save the world.
6. Game World
·         The game world will not be a single world but a separate scene for each mini-game. The world for each mini-game will reflect the nature of the game and the events taking place. Most likely, the squirrel game will have a nature aspect to it. The world for Bunny Hoo Hoo has not been determined yet.

7. Characters.  : Dr. Good Health; Sergeant Animal Talker
7.1. For each character
7.1.1. Back story :
·         Dr. Good Health: Dr. Good Health has spent a lifetime performing last minute surgeries with nothing but tweezers and a broken tooth pick. She has demonstrated her nerves of steel time and time again by creating cures at the last minute for biological weapons such as Axe deodorant and scented candles.
·         Sergeant Animal Talker: He is an expert in the ways of animals having been raised by a family of river otters since birth. Animal Talker joined the Black Ops 420 squad after a giant radioactive Candy Flier almost destroyed Philadelphia but was stopped by Animal Talker’s timely intervention.
7.1.2. Personality
·         Dr. Good Health is a calm, collected individual who never cracks under the pressure. She enjoys a good joke every now and then but tends to be more reserved.
·         Sergeant Animal Talker is a Wildman on account of being raised by otters. He loves to joke and play around.
7.1.3. Appearance
·         Dr. Good Health: unspecified at the moment
·         Sergeant Animal Talker: unspecified at the moment
7.1.4. Abilities
·         Dr. Good Health has the surest hands in the world; when the world needs a person to carefully place carrots in Bunny Hoo Hoo’s mouth, it knows who to call.
·         As indicated by his name, Animal Talker is a specialist at negotiating with animals; having been born a human but raised by otters gives him the unique perspective from both sides of a problem between animals and humans.
7.1.5. Relevance to the story
·         When the president is notified that Bunny Hoo Hoo is mere minutes from reaching critical mass and destroying the world, he immediately calls Black Ops 420 headquarters. Luckily, Dr. Good Health had just got back from curing the Yeti leader of the common cold and was able to immediately respond to the danger. Realizing that the only way to reduce Bunny Hoo Hoo’s weight is to throw carrots into her mouth, Dr. Good Health starts to chuck the carrots immediately.
·         When the president is notified that an ingredient in Starbucks coffee turns squirrels into zombie-like fur demons whose only desire is to drink more coffee he immediately calls Black Ops 420 to save the world. Having just returned from negotiating a peace treaty between humans and dolphins, Animal Talker is the perfect man for the job.
7.1.6. Relationship to other characters 
7.2. Artificial Intelligence Use in Opponent and Enemy
·         Bunny Hoo Hoo, being a human, has a human’s intelligence. She is able to tell that carrots are being thrown into her mouth and will try to close her mouth when she realizes that carrots are what are being thrown. This is what necessitates Dr. Good Health to throw decoy cupcakes in order for Bunny Hoo Hoo to reopen her mouth. Because of her mass, her muscles are no longer working properly and once she opens her mouth it takes her a while to close it again (the opposite of a crocodile).
7.3. Non-combat and Friendly Characters
