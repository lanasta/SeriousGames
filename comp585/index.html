			<h3>Project Details</p>
			<p>
				Project Manager: Kate Friedheim<br>
				Creative Editor: Seth Pyle</br>
				Game Design Document Editor: Judy Chung</br>
        Webmaster: Anastasia Lalamentik<br>
				Weekly Meeting Time: Thursday 5pm with instructor, Monday 8pm team meeting at Sitterson Lobby<br>
				<br>Client: Carolyn Quinsey (Carolyn.Quinsey@unchealth.unc.edu)<br>Organization: UNC Neurosurgery<br>
				Topic: Neurosurgery Resident Education<br>
				Objective: Radiology and Pathology flashcard like learning<br>
				Audience: Neurosurgery residents<br>
				Background: Neurosurgery residents need mental breaks when studying to retain information.  Often they feel guilty when doing intense study to take the necessary breaks for retention.  The game would provide enough humor and mental downtime so that information can be retained and meaningful.<br>
			</p>
			<h3>Short Description of the Game</h3>
			<p>The game will be an educational game that has a clear delineation between its educational and entertainment aspects.
			The game’s educational aspect will be extremely dry while the entertainment aspect will be extremely humorous.</p>
      <h3>Game Design Document</h3>
      <p>The game design document can be found <a href="gamedesign.html">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Current Stage</h3>
			<p>Initial setup for game development. The game will be web based. We will be using Github as source control and we are hoping to utilize Phaser.io as the game framework.
			The languages we will be using are Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
			<h3>Meetings with Client</h3>
			<p>1. Wednesday, 2/3/2016
				<ul>
					<li>Our goal is to cater to the neurosurgery residents' humor which is mostly immature</li>
					<li>Client wants a game leaderboard and a user database</li>
					<li>Client wants a web based game due to residents having different models of mobile devices</li>
					<li>Picture-based flashcards</li>
					<li>Client will send us a Powerpoint consisting of pictures and study terms</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Ideas</h3>
			<p>
			<b>The president has assembled a special taskforce to avert the free world from disaster</b>
			<ul>
				<li>One of the levels could be that Boney Hoo Hoo has reached critical mass and unless she can lose some weight she is going to become a black hole and consume the earth.</li>
				<li>Cat videos have grown in popularity to the point that they take up over 90% of data space on servers and all skilled workers in society spend their time trying to create better cat videos.
					This has resulted in civilization coming to a standstill. The taskforce’s mission would be to somehow eliminate cat videos or their popularity. </li>
				<li>Taylor Swift’s music turns out to be a sinister plot to turn the masses into a zombie army. The taskforce’s mission is to dodge the zombies and
					reach the loudspeakers to shut off the loudspeakers.</li>
			</ul>
